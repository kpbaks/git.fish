# git.fish
Collection of abbreviations and interactive fish-shell integrations I use to make `git` easier! 

## Requirements
- [fish ^3.6.0](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.6.0) enhanced the capabilities of `abbr` which this plugin makes use of.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) I don't hope that comes as a suprise ;-)

## Installation

Using [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

```sh
fisher install kpbs5/git.fish
```
